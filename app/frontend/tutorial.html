                    You will be dropped in a random location within Perth. You are free to explore the location as much as you wish using the Google Street View. 
                    Your goal is to guess the original location before the timer runs out!
                </p>

                    <b>Points System</b><br>The closer you are to the original location, the more points you will score.
                    If you are 45km or more away from the correct location you will gain 0 points. 
                    <br>
                    A points-time multiplier is also applied to your score. The faster you guess the correct location, the more points you will score.
                    <br>
                    The aim of the game is to be fast and accurate!
