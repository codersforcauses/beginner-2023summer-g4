            <strong>Standard: </strong>
            This game mode will depend on the difficulty level but the premise is the same.
            You wil be dropped in a location in perth, you are free to roam the location as much as is possible, but you must make a guess as to where in Perth you are within the 
            given time frame. The closer to the correct location, the higher the points. The game will take the inital drop point as the location you must guess.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>StreetSleuth: </strong>
            This game mode works a little different to the standard game mode. You will be dropped in a random location in a prominent Perth area, this might be the perth CBD,  Fremantle
            or similar. This time you will know where you have been dropped with a green flag. You will be promted with 5 different locations within that area, you must select on the map where these locations are then pinpoint them. The catch is, the map 
            will contain no labels so you must relay on the layout of the area and the street view imagery to help you. All this within a time frame of course.
